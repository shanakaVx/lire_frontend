# Steps to setup Lire front end locally #

## IMPORTANT! DO NOT code any where else, it will make the integration difficult at the end. Clone this and code on this repo. As you have separate modules there will not be merging conflicts, hopefully :) ##

## If you have anything to code with Java, please clone the Lire_Services from here [Lire_services repo](https://bitbucket.org/shanaka_vx/lire_services) ##

### Steps ###

* Clone this repository to any where.
* You will see all the project files are cloned into a folder called "LireFrontend"
* Copy and paste that folder into the C:/wamp/www/ folder !IMPORTANT! OTHERWISE WILL NOT WORK
* Then open that project in Netbeans it will run as a PHP project

### to Kim ###

* Put your whole project to this project and take the voiceuploads folder to upload user voices
* Make sub folders in that folder as the letter range- as discussed.
* Take the absolute path of voiceprofiles folder to your recording java-Spring backend service. It should be C/wamp/www/lireFrontend/voiceprofiles/
* Lire services also have some instructions
